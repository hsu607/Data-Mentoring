## Image Classification Model for Illustration Images
22.10.03~22.10.29	

## Overview
I participated in a competition to develop an AI service for classifying illustration images as a team. I worked on a project to design a classifier that can effectively classify illustration images.

## Data Preprocessing
During the exploratory data analysis (EDA) process, I identified the distribution and characteristics of the training images. I also resolved issues related to data distribution by removing irrelevant images that were mistakenly included in the training dataset.

## Model Design and Optimization
I designed and optimized the model parameters based on the preprocessed data, image processing, and neural network structure. I also analyzed the experiment results and made adjustments to optimize the model's performance.

Overall, this project enabled me to gain hands-on experience in developing a classification model for illustration images using Python and deep learning techniques.
